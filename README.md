# Metaphor ADP Server

This repository contains a server for running abductive interpretation of
metaphors. It includes a web interface and a JSON API.

## Installation

### Docker

The easiest way to install the server is using Docker.

1. Follow the [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install) to install
   Docker.

2. Clone the Metaphor ADP server repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/isi-metaphor/metaphor-adp-server
```

3. Build the Docker image for the metaphor server:

```
./build
```

4. Get a license for Gurobi for the virtual machine. Go to
   https://www.gurobi.com/features/academic-named-user-license to get a key
   and then run

```
./run-license [key]
```

The license file will be stored in the `lic` directory.

5. Run the Docker image for the metaphor server:

```
./run
```

The server will now be started on localhost, port 8000. You can send JSON
requests (see, e.g., the `testing` directory in the Metaphor ADP
repository) or use the Web interface: http://localhost:8000/app

The default username and password are both `metaphor`.


### Legacy

The directory structure should look like this:

![Directory tree](docs/directories.png)

The instructions below assume you're installing in `/research`, but this can
be any directory you prefer.

This is how to install the entire metaphor pipeline, including the web
service in this repository:

1. Clone repositories for the Metaphor ADP pipeline and for the Henry
   abductive reasoner:

```
mkdir -p /research/repo
cd /research/repo
git clone https://github.com/isi-metaphor/metaphor-adp.git metaphor
git clone https://github.com/isi-metaphor/henry-n700.git henry
```

2. Compile Henry:
- Install dependencies: python-dev, libsqlite3-dev, graphviz and python-lxml
- Compile:

```
cd /research/repo/henry
make -B
```

3. Install Boxer:
- Install Prolog: `sudo apt-get install swi-prolog`
- The official Boxer Subversion repository is no longer available, so
  clone our unofficial Git repository:

```
cd /research/repo
git clone https://github.com/jgordon/boxer
cd boxer
make
make bin/boxer
make bin/tokkie
```
- Uncompress the model in the Boxer installation directory:
```
cd /research/repo/boxer
tar xvjf models-1.02.tar.bz2
```

4. Install Gurobi: Install gurobi in a separate subdirectory of
   installation-dir (called gurobi maybe), and install the license file
   somewhere.

5. Clone the web service and set up its directories:

```
cd /research/rep
git clone https://github.com/isi-metaphor/metaphor-adp-server.git

mkdir -p /research/temp/metaphor-adp-server.tmp
mkdir -p /research/data/metaphor_kbs
mkdir -p /research/data/metaphor-adp-server
mkdir -p /research/logs/metaphor-adp-server
```

6. Install dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install fabric openssh-server screen
sudo pip install jinja2 django lz4 gitpython pexpect regex sexpdata simplejson
```

7. Deploy the web service: The git clone command just downloads the code
   but then it needs to be configured and deployed.

- Edit the file `fab/config.{branch_name}.json` depending on if
  you want to install the prod or dev branch of the web service
- For local deployment -- that is, on the same machine:
  - Check the function install in fabfile.py to make sure it runs:
    `basic_config(branch_name)`, `local_config()`, `deploy()`
  - Execute `fab install:branch_name`
- For remote deployment -- that is, the deployment directory is on another
  machine to which you have ssh access without password:
  - Edit the ssh username and ssh private key to use (`remote_config` function
    in fabfile.py)
  - Make sure you replace `local_config()` with `remote_config()` in the
    install function in `fabfile.py`
  - Execute `fab install:branch_name`

8. Initialize the database file:
- Go into the deployed directory and run:
```
python2.7 manage.py syncdb --noinput --settings=adpsrv.settings
```
- Create a user for the web interface by running:
```
python2.7 manage.py createsuperuser --username=username_to_create \
    --email=whatever@whatever --settings=adpsrv.settings
```

9. Run:
- Edit the `shell.sh` script to set the name of the screen session it'll start
  (the `-S` option)
- Run the `shell.sh` command
- Within the screen it started, start `temp_run.sh`; for monitored mode
  run `run.sh`.
- Disconnect from the screen (`Ctrl-A D`)
